# Parking-Website

1.	Project title
Parking Website

2.	Brief overview of what you are proposing 
We would like to develop a website that solves the problem of finding parking spaces. This website will help people find parking spaces by showing them the exact location and the price for the parking space. On the other side, instead of waiting on the hot sun outside of your parking lot while holding a parking side, if you own a parking space, you can put your parking space through our website for users to see. 

3.	Motivation
We have all been in many situations where we have waited 20 minutes in traffic to go to a certain parking place just to find out that all the parking spots are filled. I have seen multiple tourists in Tallahassee that come for game days absolutely get lost in a small town like Tallahassee when looking for Parking Spaces and I can only imagine how hard it is for tourists in big cities. We are here to solve that problem by just going to our website, you will be able to see all the available parking spaces in a map. 

4.	Features to be implemented and types of users
Sign In Profiles for User and Owner
In app Payments
Maps and Location
Dispatch and Tracking Panel
Communication between User and Owner

5.	Risk / Challenges
 
6.	Existing related projects
Do some research to find out if similar applications already exist. If there are similar applications, please mention them (put a link or reference to where you found them) and mention how your application will be different/better than existing projects. 

7.	Intended platform / programming language 
(e.g., iOS, Android, Web, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.)

8.	Third-party libraries / APIs to be used
Please mention any external Web service, library, database, web server, web container, application server, specialized hardware, etc. that you plan to use in your project, to the best of your abilities. 

9.	Team members, expertise, project responsibilities, and team organization
List the team members, their FSU IDs, and each member’s expertise, such as the programming languages, databases, mobile programming, platforms, APIs, etc. each is comfortable with. Mention also how your team will be organized (e.g., will you have a manager in charge of delegating tasks or will you decide together based on interests/skills?), what will be your communication like (will you use Slack, Canvas or something similar to communicate? How often will you meet in person?), etc.
